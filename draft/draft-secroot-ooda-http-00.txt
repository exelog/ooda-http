Abstract

   This document defines OODA-HTTP, an adaptive security framework
   applying the Observe-Orient-Decide-Act loop to HTTP and HTTPS
   communications. It enables dynamic threat detection and mitigation,
   including protection against quantum computing-based threats such
   as those utilizing Shor's algorithm.

1. Introduction

   HTTP and HTTPS communications face increasingly sophisticated
   threats, including quantum computing-based attacks such as those
   leveraging Shor's algorithm. OODA-HTTP introduces a real-time
   adaptive security mechanism based on the OODA loop (Observe-Orient-
   Decide-Act) to enhance resilience. The framework leverages adaptive
   security paradigms demonstrated in enterprise networks [Wang21],
   cryptographic key rotation in TLS [Gupta23], and intrusion detection
   methodologies using OODA principles [Martinez22].

2. Terminology

   Terms such as OODA loop, threat score, post-quantum cryptography,
   and Shor's algorithm are defined for clarity.

3. Architectural Overview

   OODA-HTTP integrates telemetry collection, AI-assisted analysis,
   policy-driven decision making, and dynamic enforcement within HTTP/TLS
   infrastructure.

4. OODA-HTTP Phases

4.1. Observe

   Collection of telemetry data from HTTP headers, TLS handshakes, and
   logs.

4.2. Orient

   Intelligent threat analysis leveraging AI models to score and
   classify threats, incorporating adaptive security and Quality of
   Service (QoS) principles [Sarikaya19][Zhang21].

4.3. Decide

   Policy-based decisions on mitigation strategies based on threat
   scores.

4.4. Act

   Enforcement of decisions including key rotations, blocking,
   alerting, and dynamic QoS adaptation [Gupta23][Kim23].

5. Message Formats and Protocol

   Defines JSON message schemas for data exchange between components.

6. Threat Models and Detection

   Includes classical and quantum threats with extensible detection
   methods.

7. Applications: Case Studies and Practical Validations

   Real-world deployments of adaptive security frameworks demonstrate
   effective real-time threat detection, key rotation, intrusion
   detection acceleration, and dynamic QoS management [Wang21][Gupta23]
   [Martinez22][Kim23].

8. Integration with TLS/HTTPS

   Compatibility with existing TLS termination and proxying systems.

9. Protocol Engineering Foundations

   OODA-HTTP aligns with foundational protocol engineering principles
   detailed by Sarikaya [Sar93], including state-driven systems, error
   handling, and flow control.

10. Security Considerations

   Ensures confidentiality, integrity, and mandates secure channels
   with adaptive security aligned with QoS [Sarikaya19][Zhang21].

11. IANA Considerations

   Requests registration of new message types and threat identifiers.
